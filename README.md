**Notes on the assignment:**

Google Colab was used to run the code. I had trouble renaming my SQL database file to 'healthcare.db'. Google Colab would only run if I left the name as 'your_database_name.db'. I assume I missed a step when loading my CSV file into Google colab. 

Google Colab Gemini walked me through connecting SQLite and leaving the connection open until I finished the queries. I chose not to close the connection to the SQLite database because it would sometimes prompt an error message after finishing the query and running the code.  

Each query has a short description of the data selected from the table.
